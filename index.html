 <h1>Introduction</h1> 
 <hr>
 <p>Here I used the tag <i>h1</i> to create my first level title. And to add the line under the title I used the hr tag.</p> 
    <h2>My first HTML tags</h2> <br> The <i>h2</i> tag is used to create a second level title. You can create till 6 levels of titles, ie. h1, h2...h6 
    <p>To create a paragraph, we use the tag <i>p</i>. But to avoid creating a new paragraph every time we need some space between the sentences, we can use the <i>br</i> tag.</p>
    <p>I also learned to add an emoji to my text, using the following tag: <i>&#x + an emoji code</i> that can be found at emojipedia.org. </p> 
    <p>To mark the words with a <mark>yellow marker</mark>, I used the <mark>mark</mark> tag, which is a semantic tag. For that, I first selected the word, then pressed CMD+ALT+P and typed <i>abb</i>, and selected wrap with abbreviation. Then I typed mark and ENTER. This method is really simple and very practical. </p>  
    <p>I can likewise <mark style="background-color: rgb(219, 111, 165);">change the color of my marker</mark> by using CSS features, or by inserting a <mark style="background-color: greenyellow"> <i>style</i> tag and defining a background-color</mark> into the mark tag.</p>
    <p>To make words <b>Bold</b>, I did the same procedure with the tag <i>b</i>, which is a non-semantic tag. But I can also make words <b>bold</b> by using the semantic tag: <strong>strong</strong></p>
    The same procedure can be used to make italic words: we can use the i tag, which is a non-semantic one, or the semantic em tag.
    In order to inser a picture into my html page, I use the <i>img</i> tag. As I am using the Visual Studio Code, I need just type <i>img</i> and press enter, so that all the command is writen. Inside the "", I should start writing the name of my photo file and press enter to select the file, which is suggested by the program itself. <br> I have already a picture on my file, and the VSC shows it here on the left. This is the Maluoctocat: <img src="583231.png" alt="">
