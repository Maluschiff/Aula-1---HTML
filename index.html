 <h1>Introduction</h1> 
 <p>Here I used the tag <mark>h1</mark> to create my first level title. And to add the line under the title I used the hr tag.</p> 
    <h2>My first HTML tags</h2> <br> The <mark>h2</mark> tag is used to create a second level title. You can create till 6 levels of titles, ie. h1, h2...h6 
    <p>To create a paragraph, we use the tag p. But to avoid creating a new paragraph every time we need some space between the sentences, we can use the br tag.</p>
    <p>I also learned to add an emoji to my text, using the following tag: &#x + an emoji code that can be found at emojipedia.org. </p> 
    <p>To mark the words with a yellow marker, I used the <mark>mark</mark> tag, which is a semantic tag. For that, I first selected the word, then pressed CMD+ALT+P and typed abb, and selected wrap with abbreviation. Then I typed mark and ENTER. This method is really simple and very practical. </p>  
    <p>To make words Bold, I did the same procedure with the tag b, which is a non-semantic tag. But I can also make words bold by using the em tag</p>
    <p>I can also change the color of my marker by using CSS features, or by inserting a background-color into the mark tag.</p>
