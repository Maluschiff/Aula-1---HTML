 <h1>HTML5 & CSS3</h1> 
<hr>
 <h2>Creating a HTML document</h2>
 <p>To create a new html file on Visual Studio Code you have to click on file - new file. Then click on <>index.html and on the page on the right just type ! and the code will appear automatically!</p>
 <h2>Titles & levels</h2>
 <p>Here I used the tag <i>h1</i> to create my first level title. And to add the line under the title I used the <i>br</i> tag.</p> The <i>h2</i> tag is used to create a second level title. You can create till 6 levels of titles, ie. h1, h2...h6 
    <br>
    <h2>Paragraphs</h2>

    <p>To create a paragraph, we use the tag <i>p</i>. But to avoid creating a new paragraph every time we need some space between the sentences, we can use the <i>br</i> tag.</p>
    <h2>Emojis</h2>
    <p>To add an emoji to your text, use the following tag: <i>&#x + an emoji code</i> that can be found at a lovely emoji homepage just by clicking <a href="https://emojipedia.org" target="_blank" rel="external">here.</a></p>
    <h2>Marker</h2>
    <p>To mark the words with a <mark>yellow marker</mark>, you can wrap the <mark>mark</mark> tag, which is a semantic tag. First selected the word, then press CMD+ALT+P and type <i>abb</i> on the field that appears above on the page, and select <i>wrap with abbreviation.</i> Then I type <i>mark</i> and <i>ENTER</i>. This method is really simple and very practical. </p>  
    <h2>Background Color</h2>
    <p>You can likewise <mark style="background-color: rgb(219, 111, 165);">change the color of your marker</mark> by using CSS features, or by inserting a <mark style="background-color: greenyellow"> <i>style</i> tag and defining a background-color</mark> into the mark tag.</p>
    <h2>Bold & Italic</h2>
    <p>To make words <b>Bold</b>, you do the same using the  <i>b</i> tag, which is a non-semantic tag. But you can also make words <b>bold</b> by using the semantic tag: <strong>strong</strong></p>
    The same procedure can be used to make italic words: we can use the i tag, which is a non-semantic one, or the semantic em tag.
    <h2>Pictures</h2>
    In order to insert a picture into my html page, use the <i>img</i> tag. In case you are using Visual Studio Code, you just need to type <i>img</i> and press enter, so that the command is writen on the screen. Between the quotes "", you should start writing the name of my photo file and press enter to select a file, which is suggested by the program itself. <br> I have already a picture on my file, and the VSC shows it here on the left. This is the Maluoctocat: <img src="583231.png" alt="">
    <br>
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    And this is how you create a list: <br>
    You can choose between an ordered list by using <i>ol</i>, or an unordered list, <i>ul</i>.for example: <br>
    Things that I have to do today:
    <ol type="1"> 
    <li> Brush my teeth; (very important!)
    <li> Do the homework; (not so important &#x1F643)
    <li>  Walk the dog;
    <li>  Learn to code;
    <li> Read the news.
    </ol>
<br> What I did today (here using unordered lists):
<ul type= "circle">
<li>Watched TV;
<li>Slept during the day;
<li>Ate lots of ice cream;
<li>Left all important things to do now, at the end of the day.</ul>
    <h2>Favicon</h2>
    Meanwhile, I have created my first favicon, which is easy to insert on top o my page just by using the <i>link: favicon</i> tag, on my <strong>head area.</strong>
    <p>
        <h2>Quotations</h2>

<p>It's a neu day! And today, as always, i learned something new: how to add quotes or quotations to my text. <br> There are two different types of quotations: The simple ones and the composed ones. To make a simple quotation I use the <i>q</i> tag, as follows:</p> 
My mom always says: <q>You should always pray, my dear!</q> <br>
<p>A complete quotation contains the virtual address where it can be found, which can be done using the semantic <i>blockquote</i> tag. For example:</p>
According to Keith Schengili-Roberts, we should <blockquote cite="https://www.google.de/books/edition/The_Advanced_HTML_Companion/sq4nAAAAMAAJ?hl=de&gbpv=1&bsq=html&dq=html&printsec=frontcover">write a code so that it can be easily understood later.</blockquote> which does not appear in the html text but should be used in order to preserve the author's copyrights.
</p>
<h2>Using external links</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/Maluschiff" target="_blank" rel="external" >You can access my public repository on GitHub!</a></p>
    <p>That's really cool and super easy to do! First of all I should wrap my sentence or word with the <i>a</i> tag and then write the domain just after <b>href=</b></p>
    <p>Moreover, it is possible to open the new homepage in a separate window, by typing: <b>target="_blank" rel="external"</b> just after the domain especification. I just love it!&#x2764</p>
    <h2>Using internal links</h2>
    <p>You can create a link to another page of your homework, just by wraping a sentence where your reader is supposed to click on and with the a tag, as already seen above by external links, and adding rel="next", i.e. "the following page".</p>
    <p>This is the first page of my site. You can also access my <a href="page02.html" rel="next" > second page!</a></p>
