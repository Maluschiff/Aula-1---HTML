    <title>Learning HTML</title>

 <h1>Introduction</h1> 
 <hr>
 <p>Here I used the tag <i>h1</i> to create my first level title. And to add the line under the title I used the <i>hr</i> tag.</p> 
    <h2>My first HTML tags</h2> <br> The <i>h2</i> tag is used to create a second level title. You can create till 6 levels of titles, ie. h1, h2...h6 
    <p>To create a paragraph, we use the tag <i>p</i>. But to avoid creating a new paragraph every time we need some space between the sentences, we can use the <i>br</i> tag.</p>
    <p>I also learned to add an emoji to my text, using the following tag: <i>&#x + an emoji code</i> that can be found at emojipedia.org. </p> 
    <p>To mark the words with a <mark>yellow marker</mark>, I used the <mark>mark</mark> tag, which is a semantic tag. For that, I first selected the word, then pressed CMD+ALT+P and typed <i>abb</i>, and selected wrap with abbreviation. Then I typed mark and ENTER. This method is really simple and very practical. </p>  
    <p>I can likewise <mark style="background-color: rgb(219, 111, 165);">change the color of my marker</mark> by using CSS features, or by inserting a <mark style="background-color: greenyellow"> <i>style</i> tag and defining a background-color</mark> into the mark tag.</p>
    <p>To make words <b>Bold</b>, I did the same procedure with the tag <i>b</i>, which is a non-semantic tag. But I can also make words <b>bold</b> by using the semantic tag: <strong>strong</strong></p>
    The same procedure can be used to make italic words: we can use the i tag, which is a non-semantic one, or the semantic em tag.
    In order to inser a picture into my html page, I use the <i>img</i> tag. As I am using the Visual Studio Code, I need just type <i>img</i> and press enter, so that all the command is writen. Inside the "", I should start writing the name of my photo file and press enter to select the file, which is suggested by the program itself. <br> I have already a picture on my file, and the VSC shows it here on the left. <p>This is the Maluoctocat: (so ugly the poor thing :) </p>  <p><img src="583231.png" alt=""></p>
    And this is how I create a list: <br>
    I can choose between an ordered list by using <i>ol</i>, or an unordered list, <i>ul</i>.for example: <br>
    Things that I have to do today:
    <ol type="1"> 
    <li>librush my teeth; (very important!)
    <li> Do the homework; (not so important &#x1F643)
    <li>  Walk the dog;
    <li>  Learn how to code;
    <li> Read the news.
    </ol>
<br> What I did today (here using unordered lists):
<ul type= "circle">
<li>Watched TV;
<li>Slept during the day;
<li>Ate lots of ice cream;
<li>Left all important things to do now, at the end of the day.</ul>

    Meanwhile, I have created my first favicon, which is easy to insert on top o my page just by using the <i>link: favicon</i> tag, on my <strong>head area.</strong>
    <p>
It's a neu day! And today, as always, i learned something new: how to add quotes or quotations to my text. <br> There are two different types of quotations: The simple ones and the composed ones. To make a simple cotation I use the q tag, as follows: <br>
My mom always says: <q>You should always pray, my dear!</q> <br>
A complete quotation contains the virtual address where it can be found. For example: <br>
According to Keith Schengili-Roberts, we should <blockquote cite="https://www.google.de/books/edition/The_Advanced_HTML_Companion/sq4nAAAAMAAJ?hl=de&gbpv=1&bsq=html&dq=html&printsec=frontcover">write a code so that it can be easily understood later.</blockquote> which does not appear in the html text but should be used in order to preserve the author's copyrights.
</p>
<h1>External Links</h1>
<p>That's really super interesting and super easy!. To create an external link, i.e a link to another home page, I can wrap sentences with the a tag. For example by doing so: you can also visit my <a href= target="_blank rel=external"https://github.com/Maluschiff">public repository on GitHub</a>. After the href= I should type the domain. In order to make this new homepage open in a separate window,I should add: taget="_blank external" just before the domain.</p>
